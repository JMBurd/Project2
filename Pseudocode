this is where we can put the pseudocode for Project 2

Importing library/packages
import os
import biopython
import regex



def main()
	#prompting the user interface
	#defineing varible and return varibles
	#if blank/invalid or abort selected it will close
	#if selection was invalid send up error messages error handling

	#create file browse to take a FASTA
	#select pathway to be input
	#error handling to check if valid selection

	#take file and send to data_clean()

	#take returned variable from data_clean 

	#check for valid sequence sending to sequence_check
	#if statement to get true false from system check before continue if not send back to file select

	#pass system check pass sequence variable to BWA

	#run button for BWA
	

	#this should be where BWA returns and outputs a file
	#after BWA give a command sucessful prompt or a error message if it does not execute 
	
	#output number of alignments and score matrix as a prompt
		#BWA mem [-A matchscore], [-B mmPenalty], [-O gapOpenPen] 

	#after output will force close the app/GUI


main()


def check()
	#check system type to direct reference to CMD or bash
Check()

def seq_check()
	#check to see that sequence is only ATGC
	#use biopython to check sequence change true/false variable

	#look at size from 70bp to 1000bp and send error prompt if the sequence is to large or small
		#handle through if else statments

	#return true false variable
seq_check()

def BWA()
	
	#this should take in the file and run through BWA

	#

	#when BWA is run have it send the file through samtools to make BAM file
BWA()

	#if needed
BWA_win32()



def data_clean()
	#seperate header and sequence data (regex)
	#clear white space from sequence (regex) 

	#convert test data to string for use
